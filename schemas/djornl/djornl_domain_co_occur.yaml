  title: Gene Domain Co-occurrence Edge
  description: |
    A layer of protein domain co-occurrence values from the Arabidopsis
    AraNetv2 database. The LLS scores that serve as edge values were
    calculated from weighted mutual information scores to normalize the data
    for comparison across studies and different types of data layers (Lee et
    al, 2015).
