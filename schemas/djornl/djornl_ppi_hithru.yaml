  title: High Throughput PPI
  description: |
    Log likelihood score. A layer of protein-protein interaction values
    derived from four high-throughput PPI screening experiments; from the
    Arabidopsis AraNetv2 database. The LLS scores that serve as edge values
    were calculated to normalize the data for comparison across studies and
    different types of data layers (Lee et al, 2015).
