  description: |
    A layer of protein-protein interaction values from literature-curated
    small- to medium-scale experimental data; from the Arabidopsis AraNetv2
    database. The LLS scores that serve as edge values were calculated to
    normalize the data for comparison across studies and different types of
    data layers (Lee et al, 2015).
