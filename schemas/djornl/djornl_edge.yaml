# A guide to the edge score types:

# domain_co_occur:
#   A layer of protein domain co-occurrence values from the Arabidopsis
#   AraNetv2 database. The LLS scores that serve as edge values were calculated
#   from weighted mutual information scores to normalize the data for
#   comparison across studies and different types of data layers (Lee et al,
#   2015).

# gene_coexpr:
#   A subset of pairwise gene coexpression values from the Arabidopsis
#   AraNetv2 database. The LLS scores that serve as edge values were
#   calculated from Pearson correlation coefficients to normalize the data
#   for comparison across studies and different types of data layers (Lee et
#   al, 2015).

# pheno_assn:
#   GWAS associations produced by analyzing a subset of phenotypes and SNPs
#   in the Arabidopsis 1001 Genomes database. Edge values are significant
#   association scores after FDR correction.

# ppi_hithru:
#   Log likelihood score. A layer of protein-protein interaction values
#   derived from four high-throughput PPI screening experiments; from the
#   Arabidopsis AraNetv2 database. The LLS scores that serve as edge values
#   were calculated to normalize the data for comparison across studies and
#   different types of data layers (Lee et al, 2015).

# ppi_liter:
#   A layer of protein-protein interaction values from literature-curated
#   small- to medium-scale experimental data; from the Arabidopsis AraNetv2
#   database. The LLS scores that serve as edge values were calculated to
#   normalize the data for comparison across studies and different types of
#   data layers (Lee et al, 2015).
