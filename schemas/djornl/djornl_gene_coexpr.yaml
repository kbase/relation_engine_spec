  title: Gene Co-expression Edge
  description: |
    A subset of pairwise gene coexpression values from the Arabidopsis
    AraNetv2 database. The LLS scores that serve as edge values were
    calculated from Pearson correlation coefficients to normalize the data
    for comparison across studies and different types of data layers (Lee et
    al, 2015).
